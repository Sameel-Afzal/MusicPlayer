## Getting Started

Welcome to the VS Code Java world. Here is a guideline to help you get started to write Java code in Visual Studio Code.

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `src` folder contains five Java files, namely, 
    1.`App` This file only contains `main` to start the application
    2.`AudioPlayerGUI` is the file to handle the GUI part of the application
    3.`AudioPlayer` is the file to handle the backend logic of the application
    4.`Audio` is to handle and store the audio files and its data
    5.`AudioPlaylistDialog` is to create and store the playlist files. 
- `src.assets.playlists`: to store the created playlists
- `src.assets.images`: to store the assets used along the app such as images
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies
 

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
